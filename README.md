How to Play:

Use WASD to move around the scene, and your mouse to control the camera. The reticle in the center of the screen will turn red when you hover over an interactable object, left click to pick it up or interact. When holding an object, left click to throw it or right click to drop it. Follow the instructions given in the cutscenes to complete the story.

If you encounter any weird physics bugs, please restart and try again!
